## About The Project

![azurefunction](https://grapecitycontentcdn.azureedge.net/blogs/grapecity/20181112-an-introduction-to-azure-functions-/2.png)

The project is about building a RESful API for customer to register device. This can be done by:
* Building an Azure Http Trigger Function that acts as an API. This API will also consume another API to retrieve data, namely asset id.
* Writing the data to SQL database. The data includes asset id, device id, name location and type.
* Using infrastructure as code and automated deployment pipeline. The pipeline composed of 5 stages: Create Database, Deploy Database, Build App, Deploy App and Test (Integration)

Performance requirement:
* Retry failure api request
* Process 1000 requests in 10 minutes  

Please see Integration Test Section for quality assessment.

### Built With

This section list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap the project. 
* Dotnet 7.0
* Python 3.X
* Azure Http Trigger Function
* Azure SQL Database
* Azure DevOps


### Register Device(s)

The Azure Http Trigger Function end-point:  
https://devicereg.azurewebsites.net/api/register 

To register one single device, make a post request to the endpoint with the following body:

    {
	    "devices": [
		    {
			    "id": "DVID0000001",
			    "Name": "device 1 name",
			    "location": "Melbourne",
			    "type": "Pressure Sensor"
		    }
	    ]
    }

To register multiple devices, make a post request to the endpoint with the following body:

    {
	    "devices": [
		    {
			    "id": "DVID0000001",
			    "Name": "device 1 name",
			    "location": "Melbourne",
			    "type": "Pressure Sensor"
		    },
			   // your other devices
		    {
			    "id": "DVID0000002",
			    "Name": "device 2 name",
			    "location": "Melbourne",
			    "type": "Pressure Sensor"
		    },
	    ]
    }




### Azure DevOps Pipeline
The azure-pipelines.yml contains the configuration of the pipeline.

![pipeline](https://github.com/tingkelvin/DeviceReg/assets/49113121/dfc1b9de-2f46-45c3-bbd8-64bae38ec252)
There are 5 stages:

 1. Create Database Stage - AzureCLI@1

Any commits to the main branch will trigger this pipeline.

## Integration Test 

The test is done by Pytest, a testing frame work built by Python. The test will stimulate register request concurrently to the end point

### Test 1
This test will stimulate 10 requests to register one single device to the end points.
The purpose of the test is to see if get request to retrieve asset id and retry mechanism is working.
This can be assessed by asserting response code is 200

    assert(res.status_code == 200)

Any response code rather than 200, indicates failure of the test.

### Test 2

This test is similar to previous test .  10 requests contain multiple devices registration are made to the end points.
The purpose of the test is to see if post request to retrieve multiple asset id and retry mechanism is working.
This can be assessed by asserting response code is 200

    assert(res.status_code == 200)

Any response code rather than 200, indicates failure of the test.

### Test 3

This test is a more comprehensive one. The test will read the Sample_Request.json and create a mix of single device registration and multiple device registration to the end point. The number of devices in multiple device registration is also programmed to be random. We pick a number between 1 and 50. In total, we created 1000 requests concurrently.

The script will execute "DELETE FROM [dbo].[devices]" to the SQL database to clean the database.

Frist, we assessed the retry mechanism
This can be assessed by asserting response code is 200

    assert(res.status_code == 200)

Secondly, we assessed if the total number of registration is 1000 and every request has a unique device id.

     assert(len(testDevices) == max_number and len(testDevices) == len(set(deviceIds)))

Thirdly, the duration of this test should be less than 10,

     assert(end - start < 10*60)

Lastly, the script will execute a query to database to retrieve all the deviceIds, and we check if they are the same.

     assert(deviceIds == queryDeviceIds)
     
 ### Publish Test Result
 Pytest could publish test summary and reult in xml, which Azure DevOps can display in html.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Conclusion

This was a very fun project to work. This is my first time to build a .Net application, Azure DevOps pipeline and different Azure Products.

### Things that I could do better

The CI/CD integration was extremely useful, which I should built it at the beginning of the project. I was using python to build the Azure Function, which was working fine on my computer. However, Azure Function does not support m1 python yet, hence I could not deploy the app. If I built the pipeline, I would have abled to deploy the app immediately and catch those errors earlier to speed up the development process.

A separate trigger for automated deployment would be nice. When I was making changes to the SQL data configuration. This will trigger main branch and start the whole automated deployment. There is no need to wait for the .Net to build and deploy.
